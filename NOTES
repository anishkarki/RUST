cargo new hello_cargo --bin

If we list the fles in the hello_cargo directory, we can see that Cargo
has generated two fles and one directory for us: a Cargo.toml and a
src directory with a main.rs fle inside. It has also initialized a new git
repository in the hello_cargo directory for us, along with a .gitignore
fle; you can change this to use a diﬀerent version control system, or no
version control system, by using the --vcs ﬂag
